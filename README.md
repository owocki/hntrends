# HNtrends

A front-end for a hacker news analysis project I am working on.

## What is HNTrends?

HNTrends is a tool that uses cloudsearch, ruby on rails, and a little javascript to compare & contrast the search volume for various keywords on Hacker News. TLDR -- It's Google Trends for Hacker News.

I originally built the tool as a way to combine my data warehousing expertise (acuired at Simple Energy) with my growing interest Ruby on Rails hackery (as prep for my 2015 job hunt).

Here is a screenshot of the project:

If you're interested in getting your hands on the ETL scripts that I used to download the hacker news posts and users from the API, or in extending the project, please contact me via <a href="http://twitter.com/owocki">@owocki on twitter</a> or via the email address in my github profile.
